		<h1>About Us</h1><br><br>
		<p> <span>Prowess</span> was thought into existance by John Doe. John is an entreprenuer who started a small Internet Service Provider business in 2014. A year after starting his business, John realized that this substantial market for small ISPs lacks an efficient tool to control monthly collections from subscribers. Programs and softwares avialable for use where more of accounting software and missed the primary concerns of this business sector. These softwares resulted in time consuming effort spent in monitoring and oversight and continued to cause human related errors.</p>

		<p>After scouting around for a few month, John partnered with the leading tech and software development company <strong><a href="#">Tech-c</a></strong>. Tech-c developed <span>Prowess</span> to John's specification. And know everybody happy. </p>
