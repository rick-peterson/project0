	<h1>How it works!</h1><br><br>
<div>
	<p><span> Prowess </span> is intended for use by prepaid service providers like internet reseller and satellite distributors.
	<span> Prowess </span> is designed to help you organize and manage collection of monthly subscriptions and monitor the process live via the internet.</p>
</div>
	
<div>
	<h2>Prowess Make-up and Features:</h2>
</div>
<div>
	<p><span> Prowess </span> is a web and mobile application.
		
		The “First Payment” feature from <span> Prowess </span> allows the user to determine the amount to be collected from a newly connected client.
		<span> Prowess </span> “Reports” provide the Administrator with a live update of paid and unpaid invoices as well as the “Transaction Time” and the “Employee” in charge.  
		<span> Prowess </span> allows you to upload data pertaining to all your clients through its “Import Data” feature thereby avoiding tedious manual entry.</p>
</div>
<div>
	<h2>How Prowess Works:</h2>
</div>		
		
<div>
	<p>	First you “Register” the employee names (users, supervisors, managers & admins), the “Service Plans” you offer and the “Locations” where you distribute your service. Then you upload your client data using the “Import Data” feature.<br>
		Using the mobile app, a “User” (Collection Officer) would be able to see a “Schedule” of clients with due invoices that he can visit for collection. Every time a collection is made, it is simultaneously recorded on the web for the Admin to see. <br>
		In case of a new client, the “User”, through the mobile app can create a new client account and charge the new client for a corresponding “First Payment”. Again, all of this is instantaneously recorded on the web for the Admin to monitor.<br>
		Every beginning of the month (or payment due date), new invoices are automatically generated for all “Active” clients; ready for collection.
